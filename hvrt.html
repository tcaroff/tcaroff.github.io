							The <em>Hubstairs VR Tool</em> is a toolset for interior design. Designed for professional use inside Hubstairs, a web platform connecting individuals and designers. It had to be user friendly and fun so that designers would adapt quickly, and clients would have a good time visiting their new space. The developed tools allow the user to: move, change the paints and the geometry of the room, add and manipulate pieces of furniture, then modify and precisely position them with functionalities like the group tool and finally generate beautiful renders for customer delivery.

								<h3>Designed for professionals</h3>
								<p><br>The <em>Hubstairs VR Tool</em> has been essentially developed for professional interior designers and architects to work intuitively, accurately and efficiently. For achieving this, I made technology intelligence, met professionals and tested a lot of VR applications to achieve the best result possible. I put a lot of effort to reduce the motion sickness as much as possible. It can be used all day long without being dizzy.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Ease of use and fun</h3>
								<p><br>The application must be fun, accessible to anyone, and offer a total immersion with intuitive manipulation natural navigation. For example, you can play around throwing things (simple but always fun) and playing with physics.

							<h4>Beam and laser measurer</h4>
							<p>
								The user can activate beams with side buttons. This is the only role this button has because it is quite tricky to use, given its placement. Disabling the beam is useful when handling objects, making screenshots or measuring. Indeed, it is possible to activate a laser measure on each controller, frozen when the beam is disabled.
							</p>

							<h4>Teleportation</h4>
							<p>
								You can teleport by aiming any area on the ground where the beam is green. We use a straight beam instead of a parabolic one as tests showed it was faster and more accurate to use. This function has been placed on the touchpad's click: it is the most recurrent movement to navigate in furnished spaces, so it must be fast and light. It also keeps the trigger free for interaction with objects where its use is very natural, but requires more effort for the index finger (this can be painful after a few hours of intensive use of the trigger), and is slower. The teleportation produces a fade to black to limit the motion sickness.
							</p>

							<h4>Handling furniture and objects</h4>
							<p>
								Objects and furniture can be grasped with the controller as well as with the beam. Items are highlighted when a controller or a beam comes in range. The button associated with this action is the trigger, which allows a very intuitive use as the user can act like he is actually holding the object. In this case, the object is attached to the relative position to the controller/beam when the contact occurred. All objects are subject to gravity and other forces. It is then possible to throw objects or makes objects collide, which adds a very playful aspect. When grabbing an object with the beam, the user can change the grab distance with the touchpad.
							</p>

							<h4>Object selection</h4>
							<p>
								Users can select an object with the beam. Aim to an object or a piece of furniture, so it is highlighted, and click the touchpad to select it. Objects can be unselected the same way, or just by closing the object window. Selected objects are outlined. Once selected, the object can be edited in the corresponding tab of the UI. It can be frozen to no longer be affected by forces like gravity. This option is very convenient to place a shelf or to fix an object in its final position, without the risk of jostling it by manipulating something else. It can become a ghost, only if it is frozen, so it cannot collide with other objects or scenery. Wanting to fit one object into another, such as a chandelier on the ceiling, is the typical use-case for the ghost option. This increases the scene's realism when collision masks make it impossible to achieve the desired result or place an object more easily. It is possible to display and edit to the nearest degree the rotation of an object along three axes. Objects can be duplicated or deleted. Finally, it is possible to select the desired version of the object (it often consists of different colors, woods, etc.).
							</p>

							<h4>Wall selection</h4>
							<p>
								A wall can be selected as objects are. Once a wall is selected, its appearance (texture, color ...) can be edited from the catalogue.
							</p>

							<h4>Accessibility tool for people with reduced mobility or seated work</h4>
							<p>
								hese are two buttons on the UI that can rotate the avatar 45° on itself. This tool allows, in particular, to develop (or furnish in the case of future users) without getting up too regularly or catching a stiff neck. It also increases the application's accessibility for people with a handicap.
							</p>

							<h4>Time setting</h4>
							<p>
								A scroll bar allows you to change the time so the sun's position and the lighting in the scene.
							</p>

							<h4>Wall creation</h4>
							<p>
								This tool can create any rectangular wall. There is a rectangular parallelepiped with handles on each side, and one in the middle. You can change the box's shape with the exterior handles and position it with the inside handle. The container is highlighted through any objects and shapes to avoid having a hole between two walls. Each face of a newly created wall is independently selectable to edit.
							</p>

							<h4>Double-checking template for furniture</h4>
							<p>
								This tool is used to filter furniture and is very similar to the wall-creation tool but with two boxes. Indeed, designers want pieces of furniture capable of occupying the space properly. The outer container gives the maximum size and the inner container the minimum size. Only pieces of furniture that meet the requirements in width, depth and height will then be displayed in the catalogue at that time.
							</p>

							<h4>Teleportation platform</h4>
							<p>
								In order to remain accessible to most people and avoid out of bound issues, the teleportation is restricted to the ground (or surfaces designated as teleportation zone as the stairs). To reach high places, the user can use a platform, movable like the other objects (except that it will keep its orientation to stay flat), to teleport on and come back (in case the teleportation would project the user out of the scene) with the help of two buttons on the UI. With this platform, the user can also take a more distant point of view. It is translucent enough to see below it, but not enough to provoke vertigo when the user stands on it.
							</p>

							<h4>Groups</h4>
							<p>
								It is possible to create groups to design more complex structures and move them all together. For example, if the user wants to compose a tray with many overlapping elements or a library filled with books, he can quickly move these structures. The hierarchy of a group and its subgroups is a tree: the root object is the group's owner (the library), and it moves with all its children (the books). Each child can be moved independently, and it will maintain its relative position. Besides, each child can own a group (the book at the base of a pile of books, for example).
							</p>

							<h4>Rendering</h4>
							<p>
								One of the architects' primary demand was the ability to take in-app screenshots for clients without sending files to a contractor who would generate high-fidelity images of the project. It costs less and is much faster. For that purpose, a camera can be spawned in the scene. This camera serves a dual purpose. The first is to be able to generate high-quality renders. The second is to be able to visit out of virtual reality, without having to capture the image directly from the headset, which is usually shaking and can cause motion sickness to extern viewers (as is quite visible in the video demonstration). The user can see what the camera is framing with the onboard screen. The rendering is improved on this screen with post-processing. While using this tool, the physical screen of the computer displays that view. Also, this camera embeds the NVIDIA Ansel technology, which allows high-definition renderings, up to 63,360 × 35,640 pixels (although the application resolution is 1080p), capture in 360° and binocular views (also available in high definition), particular effects of colorization, and FoV modification.
							</p>

							<h4>UI</h4>
							<p>
								To manage all these tools, a beam clickable UI can be displayed using the menu button. It has several tabs in which the tools are distributed. This interface has been designed with a size that allows reading the text but hides the scene as little as possible. It appears next to the user so that it always looks visible.

							<h2>Postmortem</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							My internship took place in an innovative and ambitious start-up, but on the fringe of the company's activity. I was also the only person in charge of the project, so I had to be proactive and bring forward proposals. It required a lot of autonomy but allowed me to take initiatives in return. These responsibilities pleased me a lot and allowed me to decide what to do with the project, which was deeply rewarding.
						</p>
						<p>
							Therefore, it was necessary to adapt very regularly and proceed incrementally. I appreciated the expertise role I endorsed. I had to make the decisions and motivate them to the team and stakeholders. This internship was a real challenge. Its innovative and uncertain nature with this boiling new technology of VR was galvanizing. I developed an application that, at the moment, although only a prototype, has no competitor. Besides, the architects and the rest of the team reacted positively, which valued my work even more. I wish I had more time to complete the project, to continue improving it and seeing it being used. Finally, I learned a lot during this internship. I had to adapt to a new approach to computing where resources must be managed in completely different ways. The education I received made it easier for me to adapt to these new concepts and define the specifications. I think I would be capable of developing this toolset with half less time at the end of the internship. It is where the proof of my learning lies.
