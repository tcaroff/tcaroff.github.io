									<h3>NVIDIA Ansel for customer delivery</h3>
									<p><br>It is a technology that allows to generate all kinds of renderings in an application: high-definition screen capture up to 63,360 × 35,640 pixels, capture in 360° and / or binocular (also available in high definition), to add particular effects
										of colorization, or to modify the field of vision.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>DGI - Dynamic Global Lighting</h3>
									<p><br>An integration strategy for Dynamic Global Illumination has been put in place for the rest of the project. It only remains to import high quality content to achieve breathtaking realism!

									<h3>Designed for professionals</h3>
									<p><br>The <em>Hubstairs VR Tool</em> has been primary developed for professional designer so they can work intuitively, accurately and efficiently. For achieving this, I made technology intelligence, met professionals and tested a lot of VR applications
										to achieve the best result possible. A lot of effort had been made for avoiding the motion sickness as much as possible, because of the tool would be heavily used by designers.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Ease to use and fun</h3>
									<p><br>The application must be fun, accessible to all and offer an intuitive manipulation of objects and a natural navigation that allows the user a total immersion in the project. You can for example play around throwing things (which is incredibly
										fun for what it is) and playing with physics.

							<h4>Beam and laser rangefinder</h4>
							<p>
								A beam can be activated with the side button, which is used for numerous tools. This button only has this responsibility because it is quite difficult to use given its placement.
								<br>Disabling the beam is useful when handling objects, making screenshots or rangefinding. Indeed, it is possible to activate a laser rangefinder on each controller, frozen when the beam is disabled.
							</p>

							<h4>Teleportation</h4>
							<p>
								The beam is used to teleport. When it is blue, it points to an area that does not allow teleportation, and when it is green the target authorizes it. For this type of movement it would also have been possible to consider a parabolic beam, but after many
								tests the straight beam seems faster and more accurate to use. This function has been placed on the click of the touch button: it is the movement that will be most often reproduced to navigate in furnished spaces, so it must be very fast and light,
								which is possible with the click of the touch button. It also keeps the trigger free for interaction with objects where its use is very natural, which requires more effort for the index (this can be painful after a few hours of intensive use of
								the trigger), and is slower. The teleportation produces a fade to black to limit the motion sickness.
							</p>

							<h4>Handling furniture and objects</h4>
							<p>
								Objects and furniture can be grasped with the controller as well as with the beam. Objects are highlighted when they passe within the range of one controller. The button associated with this action is the trigger, which allows a very intuitive when the
								user acts as if he is holding the object in his hands.<br> In this case, the movements of the controller and the beam are used to move the object which becomes fixed relative to its point of attachment, namely the controller or the point
								of intersection with the laser, which allows to manipulate it to wish and in a natural way. All objects are subject to gravity and other forces, it is then possible to throw objects and observe the physical simulation, or to push an object with
								the help of another, which adds a very playful aspect.<br> When an object is captured using the beam, the user can move it closer to or away from him using the touch capabilities of the center button. Put the thumb in y > 0 make the object move
								away, and vice versa in y
								< 0. Bigger | y | is, speeder the movement will be. </p>

									<h4>Object selection</h4>
									<p>
										It is possible to select an object with the pointer. When the beam points to an object or a piece of furniture (so it is highlighted) it is selectable by clicking on the touch button, and deselectable with the same procedure. The object is then surrounded
										by an outline to identify it. Once selected, the furniture can be edited in the corresponding tab of the interface. It can be frozen to no longer be affected by forces like gravity. This option is very convenient to put a shelf or fix an object
										in its final place, without the risk of jostling it by manipulating other objects. It can become a ghost, only if it is frozen, so it can not collide with other objects or the scenery. The typical case of using this option is when the user wants
										to fit one object into another, such as a pillow in a sofa or a chandelier on the ceiling. This option increases the realism of the scene when collision masks make impossible to achieve the desired result, or to place an object more easily.
										It is possible to display and edit to the nearest degree the rotation of an object along the three axes of space. It can be copied or deleted. Finally, all the colors or versions of the object are displayed and selectable on this same tab of
										the interface.
									</p>

									<h4>Wall selection</h4>
									<p>
										A wall can be selected as objects are. Once a wall is selected it is possible to choose its appearance (texture, color ...) from the catalog.
									</p>

									<h4>Accessibility tool for people with reduced mobility or for seated work</h4>
									<p>
										These are two buttons that can rotate the avatar 45° on itself. This tool allows in particular to develop (or furnish in the case of future users) without having to get up too regularly or catch a stiff neck by turning the head from his seat, but also
										increases the accessibility of the application for people in motor handicap situation.
									</p>

									<h4>Time setting</h4>
									<p>
										A scroll bar allows you to change the time and thus the sun-lighting of the scene.
									</p>

									<h4>Wall creation</h4>
									<p>
										It is possible to create a wall. The tool used for this is a rectangular parallelepiped with one handle on each side. It is possible to grab these handles and move the corresponding face along its orthogonal axis to change the dimensions of the wall to
										create. Concretely it is a box whose dimensions are modifiable. Another handle is used to move the container. The container is highlighted through the objects so as to avoid having a hole between two walls. Visually, when creating the wall,
										a cube is created but each face is independently selectable.
									</p>

									<h4>Double checking template for furniture</h4>
									<p>
										This tool is used to filter furniture, and is very similar to that of creating walls except that it has two containers. The idea is that to furnish a given space, the architect will look for a piece of furniture of a relatively precise size so that it
										occupies space as it should. The outer template gives the maximum size allowed for the piece of furniture, and the inner template the minimum size. Only furniture that meets the requirements in width, depth and height will then be displayed
										in the catalog at that time.
									</p>

									<h4>Teleportation platform</h4>
									<p>
										In order to remain accessible to most, the teleportation is restricted to the ground (or surfaces designated as teleportation zone as the stairs). To reach high places it is possible to use a platform, movable like the other objects (except that it will
										keep its orientation to stay flat), to teleport on and come back (in case the teleportation would project the user out of the scene) with the help of two buttons. This platform can also be used to take a more distant point of view, and is translucent
										but with a presence marked enough to avoid too strong feelings of vertigo when the user stands on it.
									</p>

									<h4>Groups</h4>
									<p>
										It is possible to create groups to design more complex structures without having to redo everything when it is necessary to manipulate them. For example, if the user wants to compose a tray with many overlapping elements, or a library filled with books,
										he can move these structures easily. The hierarchy of a group and its subgroups is a tree, the root object is the owner of the group (the library) and it moves with all its children (the books). Each son can be moved independently, and it will
										maintain its relative position in relation to its father. In addition, each son can own a group (the book at the base of a pile of books for example).
									</p>

									<h4>Generation of visual renderings</h4>
									<p>
										One of the architects' main demand was the ability to take screenshots for clients. Indeed, one of the objective of this application is to be able to do without subcontracting to realize the computer-generated images, and thus to carry out the renderings
										directly in the application. For that a button makes appear a camera in the scene. The camera serves a dual purpose. The first is to be able to generate high quality renderings. The second is to be able to visit out of virtual reality, without
										having to capture the image directly from the headset, which is usually shaking and can cause motion sickness (as is quite visible in the video demonstration). The difference is in fact between fixing a camera on the user's head, or providing
										a camera in his hands. The camera thus has a screen so that the user in the virtual reality knows what he is filming, and the rendering visible on this screen is the same as that visible on the screen of the computer when the application is
										executed (and the activated tool, otherwise it is the headset view that is active). In addition, this camera embeds the NVIDIA Ansel technology, which allows you to generate all kinds of renderings in an application: high-definition screenshots
										up to 63,360 × 35,640 pixels (although the application resolution is 1080p), capture in 360° and / or binocular (also available in high definition), to add particular effects of colorization, or to modify the field of vision. Moreover, the camera
										in question makes it possible to apply all the desired rendering and post-processing effects which are not currently supported by the camera used for the projection in the headset. This is a tool that makes it easy to generate high quality images
										for customers.
									</p>

									<h4>UI</h4>
									<p>
										To manage all these tools, a interface clickable with the beam can be displayed using the menu button. It has several tabs in which the tools are distributed. This interface has been designed with a size that allows to read the text but hides the scene
										as little as possible. It appears next to the user so that it looks always visible.

							<h2>Postmortem</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							My internship took place in an innovative and ambitious start-up, but on the fringe of the activity of the company. I was also the only person in charge of the project, and so I had to be proactive and to bring forward proposal. This required a lot of
							autonomy, but allowed to take initiatives in return. These responsibilities pleased me a lot and allowed me to manage the project at the pace I wanted and to lead it where I wanted it, which was really rewarding and convenient since I knew very
							little about it. It was therefore necessary to adapt very regularly and proceed incrementally, I also very often had to modify my code. I also greatly appreciated the role of expert that I could endorse. I was in charge of taking and justifying
							the decisions concerning the application, to make demonstrations, to motivate the potential of the application to the team and also to external people. This internship was a real challenge. Its innovative and uncertain nature, in a new area in
							full boiling was galvanizing, but the pressure was important given the ambitions of the project, and my personal ambitions in relation to it. Indeed, I developed an application that at the moment, although only a prototype, has no competitor. In
							addition, the reactions of the architects and the rest of the team were very positive and encouraging, which value all the more my work. I regret not having had more time to complete the project, to continue to evolve it, and why not see it being
							marketed. Finally, I learned a lot during this internship. I had to adapt to a new approach to computing where resources must be managed in completely different ways. The training that I received made it easier for me to adapt to these new concepts
							and to define the specifications. The proof of my learning lies, I think, in the fact that the result reached in 12 weeks is today a goal that I will be able to reach in half the time, with probably a better quality of development.
