							The theme was about <em><strong>“When superheroes have to change jobs...”</strong></em> :
							<div class="my-ratio">
								<div class="my-content">
									<em>
										We are in 2044, the President of the United States, Ivanka Trump, has managed to establish a lasting peace in the world. Thanks to superheroes, all the villains of the Earth have been defeated. In addition, the abolition of the legal profession and the disappearance of social inequalities has restored harmony across the planet. The only problem is that in this context, the superheroes who have done so much for the world are now... unemployed! What to do all these superpowers? How to make them useful otherwise? These questions remain...
									</em>
								</div>
							</div>
							<br>Imposed genres for our team (it is necessary to integrate at least two of the three genres):
							<div class="mycenter"><strong>Arcade, Management and Race.</strong></div>
							Please note that a description of the genres is available below in the section <a href="#genresDescription">Design details</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>The team</h3>
						<p>
							The team consisted of 6 people who did not know each other. The 5 other were in first year of higher education with <strong>3 programmers and 3 beginners</strong>.

							<h2>Design details</h2>

						<h3>The art</h3>
						<p>
							The art direction is <strong>fully inspired by old comics</strong>. Each hero is represented by a card just <strong>like a comic's cover</strong>, where his name, his abilities, his price and his salary are displayed. This way <strong>all the information is part of the diegesis
							of the game</strong>. The whole frame tends to <strong>replicate a comic page</strong> separating the frames with white stripes.
						</p>
						<h3 id="genresDescription">The genres</h3>
						<p>
							The following descriptions have been given by the jam staff. This section does not give details on the game himself, but we used these definitions to design the game.

							<h4>Arcade</h4>
							<p>
								The goal of an arcade game is to make the best performance through multiple sessions. We thus find games with repetitive features and whose duration is, for the most part, relatively short. The player's performance level is normally identified by his
								score. There may be some form of progression that causes the player to go as far as possible, see until the end of the game. Each arcade game contains an end-of-game condition that requires the player to start over at the beginning. The difficulty
								level of this style of play is usually high and having a steep learning curve. Roguelike type games easily enter the Arcade category in the context of a GameJam.<br>Examples: (Arcade) Super Crate Box, (Arcade and Competition) Mario vs Luigi,
								(Arcade and Survival) Crypt of the Necrodancer, Binding of Isaac.
							</p>
							<h4>Management</h4>
							<p>
								A management game sets up mechanisms, activities, an economy that the player must control and amalgamate in order to create a balance or progress in the world of the game. The video game management focuses on the resource management in order to thrive,
								it relies heavily on planning and compels the reconciliation of short-term and long-term conflicting demands.<br>Examples: (Management and puzzle) Game Dev Tycoon, (Management and Race) Grand Prix Story, (Management and survival) Shelter,
								(Management Adventure) Door Kickers, (Management, competition and strategy) Civilization.
							</p>
							<h4>Race</h4>
							<p>
								A racing game is a game whose goal is usually to progress as fast as possible from one point to another point to win. The search for speed is usually about getting to the goal first, beating a countdown, reducing a completion time, or just to survive.
								<br>Examples: (Racing and Adventure) GTA, Need for Speed ​​Hot Pursuit, (Race and Survival) Distance, (Race and Puzzle) Nimbus, Tile Rider, (Race and Multiplayer Competition) SpeedRunner, (Racing and Exploration) Hover: Revolt Of Gamers, Mirror
								Edge.

						<h3>Gameplay & Theme and genres integration</h3>
						<p>
						For the integration of the theme, the idea of an employment agency was quite evident and many other games exploited it. That were the ways to represent this agency and mechanics that accompanied which differentiated games. The kind of management was the most restrictive but it is also the one that inspired us the most, pushing us to make the main mechanics like the job of a recruiter who selects the CVs of his candidates.
						<p>
						</p>
						There are 5 sections in the main window of the game. The sections concerning the heroes are on the right, with in the upper corner the shop that allows you to use new heroes and the wallet that contains the heroes currently employed just below. Just click on a hero to engage it, and his CV will be replaced by another, so you have to be strategic about the selected heroes and CVs you don't want to keep. Each hero has his own skills such as in a RPG, a salary requirement (every second) and you have to pay a certain amount of money to see a hero join our work force (see this as a bonus to hiring or some fees) and you can dismiss them. As they rise in level, thanks to the experience gained in mission, the heroes become more powerful. Their characteristics increase as well as their salary.
						</p>
						<p>
						The missions are on the left side with from the bottom to top: future missions, missions currently available and missions you won the call for tender and are running. To achieve a mission, you need enough workforce, enough heroes and send them together. Since we are talking about superheroes, the missions can not fail and need only a certain time to be finalized, very practical isn't is? Once a mission is successful, the heroes become available again and they have gained experience. You will also have earned money and stars, which represent your reputation or success. The stars are crucial because they define the ranking and if you are not well ranked, it will be the game over. The available missions that you do not fill will be given to one of your opponents, and these will score points.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many things to manage: money and stars, heroes who cost you money for nothing if you do not send them on a mission and you have to make them gain experience, your hero wallet will be quickly big, CVs to renew, missions to watch and what they report, etc. All this is the management aspect of the game.
							It is in the star scoring system that we will find the arcade, as well as in the feeling of the game with the mouse gameplay where all action is done with a click. Everything is subject to a countdown, missions do not stay, heroes cost you money and your bank account continuously decreases. It happens that the player panics when selecting heroes for various reasons: not enough heroes available, the mission disappears before we have time to launch it, the money decreases too quickly or the score is not good enough and therefore we rush without reading the necessary characteristics and we send out the bad heroes in excess to accomplish the mission. It is therefore a perpetual race against our missionless heroes, missions deadlines, other agencies and the bank account.

							<h2>Tech details</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Made with <strong>Unity</strong>, coded in <strong>C#</strong>.
							<ul class="contact">
								<li>
									<h3>Content generation</h3><br>
									<ul class="divided">
										<li>The missions are generated with a tree. The first depth of nodes contains the action, the second depth of nodes contains who or what is concerned by the action, and the next depths contain more details like why you have to take action or how
											to do it. That way the missions have a description.</li>
										<li>Each node also contains a list of needed attributes at lvl 1, so it is possible to calculate total attributes, money, points and experience at the wanted level. For example, the “save” action needs speed.</li>
										<li>For the heroes' generation we had a bank of images representing the classical DC or Marvel heroes and others. For each image, we chose the associated attributes and different possibilities for their name.</li>
										<li>Finally, we introduced a bit of random in all the calculus process for design purpose, and we put all the elements together.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>UI</h3>
									<p><br> The UI is fully adaptable to the screen size. The cards have been designed with content generation in mind, so all elements can be resized, recolored or changed dynamically and all fit together.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Cards pooling</h3>
									<p><br> The game doesn't need a high configuration but instancing is a pretty heavy operation so to be sure that the game would always run fluidly we implemented a simple pooling system for heroes and missions' cards.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Sound manager</h3>
									<p><br> Due to the high pace of the game, we had to create a sound system that could handle a lot of sounds in parallel. In addition, we wanted the system to dynamically change the music according to the loss conditions: if the player is about to
										lose, the music becomes more urgent.

							<h2>Postmortem</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>What went right</h3>
						<p>
							During a Jam, scope matters. This may even be the most important point because if you manage to create a well finished game without being too simplistic then your creation will already stand out. Many teams failed to finalize or gave very simplistic things that only took the basic tutorials, and these teams were finally disappointed with the result. On the contrary, we had a design whose scope was perfect: we could not have finished a bigger one and the game would not have been as coherent with a smaller one. Moreover, the necessary work could be done largely by the members inexperienced team.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is indeed the second success of this jam, the teamwork has been amazing whereas nobody knew each other and there were only 3 programmers in the group. Despite, we quickly broke the ice, the design session went very well and everyone was able to participate, and the tasks were spread out so that everyone could have fun and use their skills. I was the only person to have a little experience in user interface with Unity, and our design was largely based on having a good interface, so I was in charge. Among the other two programmers, the most experienced was responsible for implementing the game manager and the procedural generation engine that we had designed together, while the other implemented all the auxiliary scripts without what the game wouldn't have work. Meanwhile, the other team members were busy finding the free graphics and sound resources, and designing the missions. The roles have evolved as time went by, once the missions done the beginners were able to join others and discover the development under Unity and even participate. The atmosphere was really good.
						</p>
						<p>
							The session to design the game was astonishingly short and productive, but we were also lucky to arrive as fast to such a design. Not only was the scope very accurate, but the theme and genres (arcade, management, race) were all very well integrated into the concept (and even artistic direction well integrated the theme, after a long moment without inspiration).
						<p>
						</p>
							Another very important point the connection between the game manager and the UI was made <em>without any problem</em>. I rarely saw it during my lifetime as a developer, especially during a jam. By staying in constant contact, with a minimum of good development practices and a distinctly defined design, it took less than 10 minutes to successfully connect them without any bug found afterwards.
						</p>
						<h3>What went wrong</h3>
						<p>
							One week after the jam we all presented our games in 2 minutes in front of the other groups and a jury. And 2 minutes, it's very short especially for pitching an original game that does not rely on mechanics already known. Even more for a management game where it is necessary to explain the depth of the game (otherwise it would be less interesting) without rushing into its complexity. I usually feel comfortable presenting projects but the time was much shorter than usual so next time it will be better to prepare this presentation and test it on people who do not know the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							Luck has been a decisive element in this jam. The chance to be in a team with whom I spent excellent 48 hours. The chance to have a very well scoped design, related to the theme and corresponding to our team. The chance to arrive at this design in just 2 hours otherwise it would have been difficult to finish the game and even the chance that the team coming in second position gave their game late, otherwise the jury's decision could have been different. Of course luck is part of the equation, but to rely on it isn't a good idea and that's why I put this paragraph here to remind myself that luck will not necessarily be with me in all my projects.
