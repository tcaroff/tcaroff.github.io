						<h3>The theme and the genres</h3>

							The theme was about <em><strong>“When superheroes have to change jobs...”</strong></em> :
							<div class="my-ratio">
								<div class="my-content">
									<em>
										In 2044, the President of the United States, Ivanka Trump, has established lasting peace in the world. Thanks to super-heroes, all the villains of the Earth have been defeated. The abolition of the legal professions and the disappearance of social inequalities have restored harmony across the planet. In this context, the only problem is that the super-heroes who have done so much for the world are now... unemployed! What to do all these superpowers? How to make them useful otherwise? These questions remain...
									</em>
								</div>
							</div>
							<br>Imposed genres for our team (it is necessary to integrate at least two of the three genres):
							<div class="mycenter"><strong>Arcade, Management and Race.</strong></div>
							Please note that a description of the genres is available below in the section <a href="#genresDescription">Design details</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>The team</h3>
						<p>
							The team consisted of 6 people who did not know each other. The 5 others people were in first year of higher education with <strong>3 programmers and 3 beginners</strong>.

							<h2>Design details</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>The art</h3>
						<p>
							The art direction is <strong>fully inspired by old comics</strong>. Each hero is represented by a card just <strong>like a comic's cover</strong>, where his name, abilities, price, and salary are displayed. This way <strong>all the information is part of the diegesis of the game</strong>. The whole frame tends to <strong>replicate a comic page</strong> separating the frames with white stripes.
						</p>
						<h3 id="genresDescription">The genres</h3>
						<p>
							The jam staff has given the following descriptions. This section does not give details on the game himself, but we used these definitions to design it.

							<h4>Arcade</h4>
							<p>
								The goal of an arcade game is to make the best performance through multiple sessions. We thus find games with repetitive features and whose duration is, for the most part, relatively short. The player's performance level is normally identified by his score. There may be some form of progression that causes the player to go as far as possible, see until the end of the game. Each arcade game contains an end-of-game condition that requires the player to start over at the beginning. The difficulty level of this style of play is usually high, and having a steep learning curve. Roguelike type games easily enter the Arcade category in the context of a GameJam.
								<br>Examples: (Arcade) Super Crate Box, (Arcade and Competition) Mario vs Luigi,
								(Arcade and Survival) Crypt of the Necrodancer, Binding of Isaac.
							</p>
							<h4>Management</h4>
							<p>
								A management game sets up mechanisms, activities, an economy that the player must control and amalgamate to create a balance or progress in the game world. The video game management focuses on resources management to thrive. It relies heavily on planning and compels the reconciliation of short-term and long-term conflicting demands.
								<br>Examples: (Management and puzzle) Game Dev Tycoon, (Management and Race) Grand Prix Story, (Management and survival) Shelter,
								(Management Adventure) Door Kickers, (Management, competition and strategy) Civilization.
							</p>
							<h4>Race</h4>
							<p>
								A racing game is a game whose goal is usually to progress as fast as possible from one point to another point to win. The search for speed is usually about getting to the goal first, beating a countdown, reducing completion time, or just to survive.
								<br>Examples: (Racing and Adventure) GTA, Need for Speed ​​Hot Pursuit, (Race and Survival) Distance, (Race and Puzzle) Nimbus, Tile Rider, (Race and Multiplayer Competition) SpeedRunner, (Racing and Exploration) Hover: Revolt Of Gamers, Mirror
								Edge.

						<h3>Gameplay & Theme and genres integration</h3>
						<p>
						For the integration of the theme, the idea of an employment agency was quite evident, and many other games exploited it. What differentiate the games were the mechanics. The management's genre was the most restrictive, but it is also the one that inspired us the most, pushing us to make the main mechanics like the job of a recruiter who selects the resumes of his candidates.
						<p>
						</p>
						There are 5 sections in the main window of the game. The sections concerning the heroes are on the right, within the upper corner, the shop allows you to use new heroes and the wallet that contains the heroes currently employed just below. Just click on a hero to engage it, and another will replace his resume, so you have to be strategic about the selected heroes and resumes you don't want to keep. Each hero has his own skills as in RPGs, a salary requirement (every second), and you have to pay a certain amount of money to see a hero join our workforce (see this as a bonus to hiring or some fees), and you can dismiss them. As they rise in level, thanks to the experience gained in mission, the heroes become more powerful. Their characteristics increase as well as their salary.
						</p>
						<p>
						The missions are on the left side, then from the bottom to top: future missions, missions currently available and missions you won the tender (those ones are running). To achieve a mission, you need enough workforce, enough heroes and send them together. Since we are talking about super-heroes, the missions can not fail and need only a certain time to be finalized. Very practical, isn't is? Once a mission is successful, the heroes become available again, and they have gained experience. You will also have earned money and stars, which represent your reputation or success. The stars are crucial because they define your ranking, which, if it is not high enough, the game will be over. The available missions that you do not fill will be given to one of your opponents, and these will score points.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many things to manage: money and stars, heroes who cost you money for nothing if you do not send them on a mission and you have to make them gain experience, your hero wallet will be quickly big, resumes to renew, missions to watch and what they report, etc. All this is the management aspect of the game. The arcade aspect of the game is visible within the need to keep scoring stars and the frenetic clicking gameplay. Everything is subject to a countdown, missions do not stay, heroes cost you money, and your bank account continuously decreases. It happens that the player panics when selecting heroes for various reasons: not enough heroes available, the mission disappears before we have time to launch it, the money decreases too quickly, or the score is not good enough, so we rush without reading the necessary characteristics and send out the bad heroes in excess to accomplish the mission. Therefore, it is a perpetual race against our jobless heroes, missions deadlines, other agencies, and the bank account.

							<h2>Tech details</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Made with <strong>Unity</strong>, coded in <strong>C#</strong>.
							<ul class="contact">
								<li>
									<h3>Content generation</h3><br>
									<ul class="divided">
										<li>The missions are generated with a tree. The first depth of nodes contains the action, the second depth of nodes contains who or what is concerned by the action, and the next depths contain more details like why you have to take action or how to do it. That way, missions have a description.</li>
										<li>Each node also contains a list of needed attributes at level 1, so it is possible to calculate total attributes, money, points and experience at the wanted level. For example, the "save" action needs speed.</li>
										<li>We had a bank of images representing the classical DC or Marvel heroes and others for the heroes' generation. For each image, we chose the associated attributes and different possibilities for their name.</li>
										<li>Finally, we introduced a bit of random in all the calculus process for design purpose, and we put all the elements together.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>UI</h3>
									<p><br> The UI is fully adaptable to the screen size. The cards have been designed with content generation in mind so that all elements can be resized, recolored or changed dynamically and all fit together.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Cards pooling</h3>
									<p><br> The game doesn't need a high configuration but instancing is a pretty heavy operation. To ensure that the game would always run fluidly, we implemented a simple pooling system for heroes and mission cards.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Sound manager</h3>
									<p><br> Due to the high pace of the game, we had to create a sound system that could handle many sounds in parallel. Also, we wanted the system to change the music according to the loss conditions dynamically: if the player is about to lose, the music becomes more urgent.
									</p>

							<h2>Postmortem</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>What went right</h3>
						<p>
							During a Jam, scope matters. This may even be the most important point because if you manage to create a well-finished game without being too simplistic, your creation will already stand out. Many teams failed to finalize or gave very simple things that only took the basic tutorials, and these teams were finally disappointed with the result. On the contrary, we had a design whose scope was perfect: we could not have finished a bigger one, and the game would not have been as coherent with a smaller one. Moreover, the necessary work could be done largely by the team's less experienced members.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is indeed the second success of this jam. The teamwork has been amazing whereas nobody knew each other, and there were only 3 programmers in the group. Despite, we quickly broke the ice, the design session went very well, everyone participated, and the tasks were spread out to have fun and learn. I was the only person to have a little experience in UI with Unity, and our design was largely based on having a good interface, so I was in charge of that. Among the other two programmers, the most experienced was responsible for implementing the game manager and the procedural generation engine that we had designed together. The last one implemented all the auxiliary scripts without what the game wouldn't have work. Meanwhile, the other team members were busy finding graphics and sound resources and designing the missions. The roles have evolved as time went by. Once the missions were done, the beginners could join others and discover the development under Unity and even participate. The atmosphere was really good.
						</p>
						<p>
							The session to design the game was astonishingly short and productive, but we were also lucky to arrive at such a design quickly. Not only was the scope very accurate, but the theme and genres (arcade, management, race) were all very well integrated into the concept (and even artistic direction well integrated the theme, after a long moment without inspiration).
						<p>
						</p>
							Another very important point the connection between the game manager and the UI was made <em>without any problem</em>. I rarely saw it during my lifetime as a developer, especially during a jam. By staying in constant contact, with a minimum of good development practices and a distinctly defined design, it took less than 10 minutes to successfully connect them without any bug found afterwards.
						</p>
						<h3>What went wrong</h3>
						<p>
							One week after the jam, we all presented our games in 2 minutes in front of the other groups and a jury. And 2 minutes, it's very short, especially for pitching an original game that does not rely on mechanics already known. Even more for a management game where it is necessary to explain the game's depth (otherwise it would be less interesting) without rushing into its complexity. I usually feel comfortable presenting projects, but the time was much shorter than usual, so next time it will be better to prepare this presentation and test it on people who do not know the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							Luck has been a decisive element in this jam. The chance to be in a team with whom I spent excellent 48 hours. The chance to have a very well-scoped design related to the theme and corresponding to our team. The chance to arrive at this design in just 2 hours otherwise it would have been difficult to finish the game, and even the chance that the team coming in second position gave their game late, otherwise the jury's decision could have been different. Of course, luck is part of the equation, but to rely on it isn't a good idea, and that's why I put this paragraph here to remind myself that luck will not necessarily be with me in all my projects.
