						<h3>What went right</h3>
						<p>
							We had three objectives with this project: to set up true good development practices, to look for great technical challenges and to allow everyone to explore an area they like. For the first point we set up pair programming, a very strict scrum schedule,
							a good QA, code review ... In short, the idea was to be able to really use all these practices that we had learned but which often end up not being respected in school projects because delays are very short, the teams are reduced and that the students
							are not often evaluate on the methods but more on the result. I am very pleased with what we have done for this project, which has required a lot of work and rigor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Regarding the technical challenges, there was something for everyone. Portal's mechanics with the necessary spatial geometry, scene management, all kinds of code to handle special cases, handling shaders, optimization, etc. The artificial intelligence
							of the mobs and npcs whose whole system of perception and sending of message has been redone. The system of animation and combat where we wanted to have a physical responses... It was really nice to finally arrive at a prototype with very advanced
							features that no other group had done. We learned a lot and everyone was able to work on at least one thing he wanted to explore.
						</p>
						<p>
							We used Perforce for code versioning ... and it's so cool. After using svn and git which are not very suitable for game development, and the Unity Collab which can be whimsical or completely non-functional sometimes, using Perforce in Unreal is a real
							pleasure. Both are perfectly integrated, Perforce handles large amounts of data without problems (our project was bigger than 40GO), there was almost no problem. This illustrates the importance of working with the right tools.
						</p>
						<h3>What went wrong</h3>
						<p>
							The game mechanics were very much based on the level design, and we spent a lot of time to achieve to make a level that is not too straight, with verticality and different situations of games. But finally the result is far from excellent and it required
							a very large amount of work. This is not my area of expertise of course, but I found it particularly difficult and it certainly deserves more learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							The scope was gigantic. Initially it was wanted since we wanted to explore as many areas as possible and create a game in the style of what can be found on the AAA market. Of course, it was expected that we can not do everything. However, we made the
							mistake of spreading over topics that would have been better not to just surface and focus on the important elements. Moreover, since this work was academic, and although we had meant our desire to work in an unusual way, it was expected that we
							provide a game and not a prototype at the end of the session. It was therefore necessary to re-scope the project several times and modify it to achieve the objectives, the discussions were sometimes heated with the supervisors and we were not able
							to lead the project as we wanted even if I sincerely believe that it would have been much more rewarding. I regret that in a school context, where the goal is above all to learn and train, that there is no more openness and reward for taking risks
							where it is under control. I guess the industry also has its own hazards and sometimes you have to go ahead with a project in a difficult environment. This is something obvious, but living it has allowed me to begin to build an experience that
							will allow me to navigate better in troubled waters in the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game was not very fun. It has good potential, but the fact is that we have not been able to finalize all aspects and that our skill set was not wide enough to cover everything. Therefore, the gameloop is not really finalized, we did not have much
							time to test and rework the game, and so it is not fun. Even if it was not our primary goal, because we wanted above all to create a kind of technical demo, it is quite sad to realize it.
