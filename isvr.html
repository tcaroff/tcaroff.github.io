								Proprioception is “the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">Wikipedia</a>). This game is a cognitive and sensory
								experience that links playful, scientific and educational aspects. It pushes the player to become aware of his proprioception and to explore it.

						<h3>Exercices</h3>
						<p>There are three exercises available, and each day the difficulty level increases.</p>
						<h4>The invisible Man</h4>
						<p>
							During this phase, the player must manipulate an object according to a precise trajectory but without being able to see the object or the controllers. When the player drops the object, its trajectory is displayed so that the player can see the movements
							he has made. During these exercises, a camera tracks the object to give to the player a clue about where the object is.
						</p>
						<h4>Haptic zone</h4>
						<p>
							The player can draw lines between his two hands and must recognize shapes using haptic feedback from controllers. The difficulty of this exercise is to make sure that the drawn edges correspond to the shape.
						</p>
						<h4>Camera vision</h4>
						<p>
							In this exercise, the player's vision is fixed to the position of a security camera, far from his body. He must manipulate objects while his vision does not follow the movement of his head.
						</p>
						<h3>Storytelling</h3>
						<p>
							We wanted the environment to react to our actions. Thus, when the player does not correctly perform an exercise, he is called back to order and must comply with the rules. We do this because the player is experimenting with his proprioception, the goal
							is to put the player in a guinea pig role so that he carries out the exercises carefully. The player thus embodies an intern whose supervisor is a mad scientist who does not hesitate to put the player back in his place as soon as he makes an action
							that would not be considered well if it was made outside a game. The player never sees him and is watched by a camera that tracks him, There is also a lot of humor so that the game is not too destabilizing or anxyogenous but our tests have been
							very conclusive: the players are first surprised by these sermont and perform very conscientiously the exercises which allows to discover their sense of proprioception. Then when they feel more comfortable, they experience by their own by disobeying
							orders.
